# Blueberry Design System Knowledge Base

This directory contains the complete documentation and guidelines for the Blueberry Design System. The MCP server uses this knowledge base to provide expert guidance on component usage, Tailwind tokens, and design patterns.

## Structure

- `components/` - Component documentation and usage guidelines
- `tokens/` - Design token specifications and usage rules
- `patterns/` - Common UI patterns and best practices
- `reference/` - Reference implementations (dashboard as golden standard)
- `rules/` - Enforcement rules for consistency

## Usage by MCP Server

The MCP server indexes this knowledge base and uses it to:
1. Answer design system queries
2. Validate component implementations
3. Suggest improvements
4. Compare new implementations against reference examples
